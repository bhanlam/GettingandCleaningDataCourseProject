## Difference with original dataset

The dataset to be analysed is downloaded from: 
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>
\  

The companion site for the dataset can be accessed from:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
\  

Although there are no major changes to the variable names, the Table 1 below will summarise the abbreviations used in the variable names in the final output file *"avgbyparticipant.txt"*. An indication of *NA* signifies no changes to the orginal abbreviations or absence in the original dataset.
